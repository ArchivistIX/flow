## Design

The website uses a palette of blues that are reminiscent of sea. The colour palette was discovered at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/surfs-up-2/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Sansita is used for headings on the site.

* Open-sans is used for the body text on the site.  

### Imagery

Images used were from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) website. I have credited these in the [credits](#Credits) section.

### Features

The website is comprised of five pages, all of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, exercises page, lessons page, team page and contact page).

* All Pages on the website have:

  * A responsive navigation bar at the top right which allows the user to navigate through the site.  To the left of the navigation bar is a logo together with the text Flow. To allow a good user experience of the site, the navigation bar is responsive with a media query on mobile devices to prevent the navigation bar looking cluttered. When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a column underneath the logo. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience.

  * A footer which contains social media links, with icons, to instagram, facebook and twitter, and also to different pages on the website.

* Home Page.
  * Hero Image.
  Hero image and animated words show spirit of surfing and set the right tone for the whole website.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

* Exercises, Lessons and Team pages had responsivnes issues where images and videos were outside the viewport on smaller screens, not centered - slightly to the righ side.
* HTML code needed clean up and organising.
* There was some html validation issues, of validator showing that sections needed h1-h6 elements, however they are not needed.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website.
No error are shown. Just warnings that section lacks heading, however it is not needed.

CSS validation passes, no errors no warnings.

### Solved Bugs

1. The navbar would lose its alignment when on smaller devices. This did not make for a good user experience, as the sites navigation for other sizes is on the right hand side of the navbar. I have designed it to fall down in a column on smaller devices.

2. Lessons paragraph was adding another container over an existing container, which resulted in a messy screen flled with unecessary parts, when on smaller devices. That was resolved by erasing media queries for .intro-lessons, as there was media queries already applied.

3. Quick links on the welcome page, just underneath the Hero image were outside the viewport on smaller devices, that was solved by applying flex of column direction.

4. Animated word FLOW was fading out of the screen. That was solved by keeping the animation at 100% at the last frame.

5. Images and videos were misaligned on Lessons, Exercises and Team pages. Removing some padding commands solved the issue.

6. Footer misaligned on some mobile devices. Issue solved by changing some padding settings.
